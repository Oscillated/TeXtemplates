\section{Examples}

\begin{frame}{Cow study}
The quantity of bacteria per $\text{cm}^3$ of milk from eight different cows is estimated after milking and 24h later. We wish to test whether the quantity of bacteria significantly increases with time.

\item Answer the question under the assumption of normality of the data.
\item Answer the question using a sign test.
\item Answer the question using a Wilcoxon's signed rank test.

\begin{frame}{Number of patients in the emergency ward}
To study the variation of the number of emergency cases in a hospital, the number of patients was counted for the months of June, July and August. The results are

\end{figure}
Can we conclude that the proportion of emergency cases is the same every month?

\begin{frame}{Cell phone and driving reaction time}
Let's assume that you know from past experience that reaction time has a standard deviation of $1.25$ seconds. Also suppose that a $1$-second difference in reaction time is considered an important difference. You want to conduct a two-sided significance test at $5\%$ level with $90\%$ power to detect such a difference if it exists. How many participants will you need in your study?

To design such experiment, what else do you need?
